          I am a web developer, veteran, and emergency communications officer
          that lives in Nampa, Idaho. I am originally from the small town of Oak
          Ridge, North Carolina. I served in the Marine Corps as a Combat
          Engineer and in the Navy as an Aviation Ordnanceman. I have been
          married for 16 years. We have three dogs and two cats.

            How Fly Fishing Looks in My Dreams

        <p class="container_content">
          I enjoy fishing. There is nothing greater than being out on the water
          surrounded by nature. I recently took up fly fishing. It has been an
          extremely challenging and expensive new hobby. It definely takes a lot
          of patience, but is rewarding by helping you to clear your mind.
        </p>

        <p class="container_content">
          I also enjoy listening to metal music. I listen mostly to sludge, folk
          metal, doom/stoner metal, speed metal, and thrash metal. I also enjoy
          playing video games, hunting, watching MMA, and reading.
